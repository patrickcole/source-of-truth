# Base Element

Used to set properties for all included anchor `<a>` tags in a document. Useful for setting all links to open in new tab/window.

```html
<head>
  <base target="_blank">
</head>
```

Also possible to set the `<base href="">` to a URL to create an absolute link for each link. Helpful for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
