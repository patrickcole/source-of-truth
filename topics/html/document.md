## Optional Tags

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<body>`

Each of the tags above are optional as the browser will auto-generate them as part of its default instructions. However, any properties that need to be added to them, such as `id` or `class` or `style` MUST be done via JavaScript **after the page loads**
